### Blanker™
Blanker™ is a file (so it won't get blocked) that lets you open websites in an about:blank tab, which is a tab that doesn't let the teachers see what's on your screen. Some websites may break using it, but there should be a constantly updated list of websites that work using it. Feel free to make a issue or pull request to add more websites to it.
